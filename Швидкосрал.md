# Summary of changes made in the Швидкосрал-Edition #
- **BIC-5 – Customizable objects print order.** Adds a dedicated reorder mode so users can click objects on the active plate and assign the exact intra-layer sequence they want. See PR https://github.com/bickus/OrcaSlicerFork/pull/1.
- **BIC-6 – Profile renaming.** Introduces rename for printer and material profiles. Rename moves the underlying preset files, updates IDs, and propagates the change through compatible printers, materials, and physical printer bindings. History of renames is preserved so when an old project is opened which references a renamed profile - a user gets an option to update the reference in the project file. See PR https://github.com/bickus/OrcaSlicerFork/pull/2.
- **BIC-8 – Bridge infill line width controls.** Adds separate line-width parameters for bridge infill and internal bridge infill in Quality -> Line Width so users can tune these flows independently. See PR https://github.com/bickus/OrcaSlicerFork/pull/4.
- **BIC-10 – Granular bridge acceleration and jerk.** Lets users dial different acceleration and jerk values for external and internal bridges so overhangs stay stable without slowing solid infill. See PR https://github.com/bickus/OrcaSlicerFork/pull/5.
- **BIC-12 – Improved seam placement on unsupported edges.** Adds a Seam to Overhang Distance guard in Quality -> Overhangs so seams stay a configurable distance away from the start of bridges and steep overhangs when possible. See PR https://github.com/bickus/OrcaSlicerFork/pull/6.
